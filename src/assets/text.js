    interests: 'I\'m interested in how nature and the environment affect our choices and thoughts. This could be a little bit abstract but I spend my free time being a strict contact with nature. I like to take small breaks from my activities in my garden and when it\'s not possible just watching buildings, people movements and other things that could inspire me. I do not consider my self as \'sportive\' person but in winter I love snowboarding and in summer mountain biking. When I\'m forced indoor, I follow sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows. I like to think about me as an aspiring problem-solver, that spend time exploring the latest technology in the software development and design interaction.',
